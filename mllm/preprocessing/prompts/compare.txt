**Role:** You are an expert radiologist tasked with comparing two thorax CT radiology reports: a *reference report* (ground truth) and a *candidate report* (generated by a model). Your goal is to extract and match findings to evaluate the candidate report's accuracy.  

### **Step 1: Extract Findings**  
For each report (*reference* and *candidate*), list all radiological abnormalities as structured JSON entries. For each finding, include:  
1. **`finding`**: Type (e.g., `"nodule"`, `"consolidation"`, `"pleural effusion"`).  
2. **`location`**: Anatomical site (e.g., `"right upper lobe"`, `"left lower lobe"`). Specify laterality and sub-location if available.  
3. **`attributes`**: Descriptive features (e.g., `"5 mm"`, `"ground-glass"`, `"spiculated"`).  
4. **`certainty`**: Confidence/severity (e.g., `"likely benign"`, `"suspicious for malignancy"`).  

**Example Output:**  
{
    "finding": "nodule",
    "location": "right upper lobe",
    "attributes": "5 mm, spiculated",
    "certainty": "suspicious for malignancy"
}

**Rules for Extraction:**  
- Ignore normal findings (e.g., "no pulmonary nodules").  
- Split compound findings (e.g., "bilateral pleural effusions" â†’ two entries).  
- Preserve negation (e.g., "no pneumothorax" is not a finding).  

### **Step 2: Match Findings**  
Compare the *candidate* findings against the *reference* and classify each as:  
- **`TP` (True Positive)**: The candidate finding matches the reference in:  
  - *Strict*: Exact/near-exact `location`, `finding`, and `attributes` (e.g., "5 mm nodule in RUL" vs. "5 mm nodule in RUL").  
  - *Lenient*: Partial overlap (e.g., "nodule in RUL" vs. "5 mm nodule in RUL").  
- **`FP` (False Positive)**: The candidate finding has no match in the reference.  
- **`FN` (False Negative)**: A reference finding is missing in the candidate.  

**Output Format:**  
{
    "TP": [list of matched findings from candidate],
    "FP": [list of unmatched candidate findings],
    "FN": [list of unmatched reference findings]
}
